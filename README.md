User Story:

AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


Description:
======
For the Portfolio assignment, I've created my page using HTML, CSS, and Github to inform employers of my accomplishments using those programming languages.
